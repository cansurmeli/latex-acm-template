# README

This is a minimal and abstract LaTeX template with the style of ACM.

## Folder `docker`

I strongly prefer to export my LaTeX via Docker. Local installations of LaTeX requires too much storage space, has many dependencies, and gets into trouble with directory names in a complicated file-system.

Therefore, it is much simpler to just Dockerise the whole thing and work from there.

## Folder `milestones`

I find this to be a good trick to get organised. As you reach certain milestones in writing your LaTeX and export a PDF, keep milestone PDFs under this location for future references.

Sure, your LaTeX is best served under Git but it is still a neat little trick.
